🚗 Safe Steer Assistant

Safe Steer Assistant is a real-time driver monitoring system that detects drowsiness and distraction using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It uses trained CNN models to monitor the driver's facial cues and provides audible alerts to enhance road safety.


🔍 Description

Safe Steer Assistant is divided into three major components:

Drowsiness Detection:

Trained CNN model to detect eye closure.

Uses Haarcascade classifiers for eye and face detection.

Real-time drowsiness detection in real-time-monitoring.py.


Distraction Detection:

CNN model trained to recognize attention loss or head turns.

Model training in Distraction Detection Model Training.ipynb.

Real-time inference in real_time_distraction_monitoring.py.


Final Module:

Unified script: real_time_monitoring.py

Loads both models and provides consolidated real-time monitoring and alerting.


✅ Features

Real-time webcam-based monitoring

Drowsiness detection via eye state

Distraction detection via attention classification

Alerts using audio cues to prevent accidents

Trained models in .h5 formats

Modular structure for training and deployment
